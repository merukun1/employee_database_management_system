# employee_database_management_system

This Java program is a simple employee database management system. It allows an administrator to perform various tasks such as adding new employees, viewing a list of all employees, searching for a specific employee, removing an employee, updating an employee's information, and viewing payroll information.

The program begins by prompting the user to enter their username and password. If the username is "admin" and the password is "admin", the user is granted access to the program. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.

Once the user has logged in, they are presented with a menu of options to choose from. The user can enter a number between 1 and 6 to select a specific task to perform. The tasks are:

1. Add Employee: This option allows the user to add one or more new employees to the database by prompting the user to enter the employees' information such as their name, job title, department, salary, and contact details.

2. View all Employee: This option displays a list of all employees in the database, including their name, job title, department, salary, and contact details.

3. Search Employee: This option allows the user to search for a specific employee by entering their name or employee ID. If the employee is found, their information is displayed.

4. Remove Employee: This option allows the user to remove an employee from the database by entering their employee ID.

5. Update Employee: This option allows the user to update an employee's information by entering their employee ID and the new information.

6. Payroll: This option displays payroll information such as the total number of employees, the total salary cost, and the average salary.

The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit. If the user selects the "exit" option, the program terminates. Otherwise, the user is returned to the main menu to select another task.
